        This Privacy Policy describes how your personal information is
        collected, used, and shared when you visit or make a purchase from
        shop.reisetra.co (the “Site”) and Reisetra Enterprises ("the legal
        entity")
        <br />
        <br /> <strong>Personal information we collect</strong> <br /> When you
        visit the Site, we automatically collect certain information about your
        device, including information about your web browser, IP address, time
        zone, and some of the cookies that are installed on your device.
        Additionally, as you browse the Site, we collect information about the
        individual web pages or products that you view, what websites or search
        terms referred you to the Site, and information about how you interact
        with the Site. We refer to this automatically-collected information as
        “Device Information”. <br /> <br /> We collect Device Information using
        the following technologies: <br /> - “Cookies” are data files that are
        placed on your device or computer and often include an anonymous unique
        identifier. For more information about cookies, and how to disable
        cookies, visit http://www.allaboutcookies.org. <br /> - “Log files”
        track actions occurring on the Site, and collect data including your IP
        address, browser type, Internet service provider, referring/exit pages,
        and date/time stamps. <br /> - “Web beacons”, “tags”, and “pixels” are
        electronic files used to record information about how you browse the
        Site. <br /> <br /> <br /> Additionally when you make a purchase or

        address, payment information (including credit card numbers, debit card
        numbers, email address, and phone number. We refer to this information
        as “Order Information”. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> When we talk about
        “Personal Information” in this Privacy Policy, we are talking both about
        Device Information and Order Information. <br /> <br />{' '}
        <strong>How do we use your personal information?</strong> <br /> We use
        the Order Information that we collect generally to fulfill any orders

        confirmations). Additionally, we use this Order Information to: <br /> -
        Communicate with you; <br /> - Screen our orders for potential risk or
        fraud; and <br /> - When in line with the preferences you have shared
        with us, provide you with information or advertising relating to our
        products or services. <br /> <br /> <br /> We use the Device Information
        that we collect to help us screen for potential risk and fraud (in
        particular, your IP address), and more generally to improve and optimize
        our Site (for example, by generating analytics about how our customers
        browse and interact with the Site, and to assess the success of our
        marketing and advertising campaigns). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />{' '}
